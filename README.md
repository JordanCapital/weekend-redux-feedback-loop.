# Project Name
Weekend feedback app

## Description
This is a reflection form modeled after Prime's system. It allows users to leave feedback for the day.

The project has FOUR sections. The Feeling, understanding, support and comments section. Each section only allows the user to advance to the next section if Only the score was provided.


The last step of the process allows the user to REVIEW their feedback and are not able to change their inputs

I have the database set up for it.
